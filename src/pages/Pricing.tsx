export const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What exactly does the ₹399 package include?",
    a: "Your ₹399 covers everything needed to run one campaign: ₹300 of advertising media spend on your selected platforms, a ₹70 campaign management fee for setup, targeting and optimisation, and ₹29 GST. There are no hidden charges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are 7,000–10,000 views guaranteed?",
    a: "No — and we will never promise that. 7,000–10,000 views is an estimated target based on similar campaigns. Actual performance depends on the advertising platform, your audience, creative quality and campaign conditions. Your dashboard always shows real, verified numbers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which platforms can I advertise on?",
    a: "You can choose from Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Google during booking. Platform availability depends on your creative — for example, YouTube requires a video. Eligible platforms are shown clearly in the booking flow.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take for my campaign to go live?",
    a: "Most campaigns are reviewed within 24–48 hours. Once approved, your campaign is scheduled and launched, and you can follow every status change from your dashboard and notifications.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I track my campaign's performance?",
    a: "Every customer gets a personal dashboard with total views, reach and platform-wise statistics for Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Google. You can view daily performance, compare platforms and download branded PDF reports anytime.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need my own advertising accounts?",
    a: "No. Campaigns are created, managed and optimised by the Beyond Reach team on managed advertising accounts, so you never have to deal with Ads Manager complexity.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your refund policy?",
    a: "If we cannot launch your campaign, you receive a full refund. If a campaign is stopped early by us, the unspent media budget is refunded. Once a campaign is live, spent media budget is non-refundable. See the full Refund Policy for details.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run more campaigns or increase my budget later?",
    a: "Yes. You can book additional Starter Reach campaigns anytime from your dashboard. Larger packages are in development — join the waitlist on the pricing page to be notified.",
  },
